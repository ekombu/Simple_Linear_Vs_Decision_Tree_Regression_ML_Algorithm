# salary_dataset
In this example, I compare a simple linear regression and decision tree regression result on a salary dataset. Here I used year of experience to predict salary. Lesson learnt: The linear regression algorithm returns 90% R-square with or without transforming the dataset. Decision tree regression on the other returns 74% R-square.
